        <p>
          Hello, in this website I will show you the stuff I use when working on
          a personal project or work tasks. I have been privileged to work from
          home which makes working A LOT more comfortable and can focus on
          nothing but getting stuff done, so that means I can freely use
          hardware that I like.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my preference, I like it to be as minimal as possible, and try not
          add a lot of stuff in my setup since I am going for that clean look. Also, I mostly tend to get a dark aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the selection of components and peripherals that I use to get
          the most of productivity and an enjoyable experience while developing.

            <p class="details__description">Working for long hours while standing down can be quite harmful for your posture, which is quite concerning. So I looked into standing desks, and luckily after a lot of patience I found this one on Facebook Marketplace for cheap. I can say it's an investment you will never regret. At the times when I get tired of sitting down, I hold a button to adjust the height to a standing position; or click on one of my saved height presets.</p>

            <p class="details__description">While I mostly like to work sitting down, I must pick a chair that is quite comfortable, and also look great. I came across this chair on a flea market near where I live. The chair has a mesh support on the back so it can breathe air and prevent me from sweating on a hot day. Arm rests where I can freely move to my comfort. Overall it's a great ergonomic chair, but would like to explore other higher reviewed chairs. </p>

            <p class="details__description">The size of this monitor can fit many programs in one viewing, so that means less switching across programs that are in full screen. The resolution is 3440x1440p which can display programs without sacrificing quality. A must have for coding developers.</p>

            <p class="details__description">I really don't use a second monitor since my main monitor has enough display to fit all my programs that I work with, in some occasions it's good to have an additional monitor to have something for reference or a video that I'm following along to. Another benefit about this monitor is that it has an IPS panel; which display a more accurate color representation than my main monitor</p>

            <p class="details__description">Having a monitor arm is a great adition to your workspace setup, not only does it mount your monitor to your desired position; it frees up space in your desk from those weird looking monitor stands that come included in each monitor. I can position my second monitor vertically when I need to, or also bring up my monitor closer to my eyes for a better viewing. This monitor mount supports up to two 34 inch monitors side by side, perfect for my setup.</p>

            <p class="details__description">I built my PC in 2019. It's very capable of doing the stuff I do with ease and without struggle. The components are mainly for gaming purposes, but it can do the job done for any heavy work tasks. The list of components are:</p>

            <h2 class="details__heading">Keychron K12</h2>
            <p class="details__description">I always saw in other peoples setups that they had custom keyboards. So I decided to see what they where all about, and I must say; it makes typing much more pleasing. I bought this entry level mechanical keyboard, so far it's been great, I added some Gateron Ink v2 linear switches for a better typing experience and sound, I have installed IDOBAO PBT keycaps, and added a tape mod to dampen the sound while typing. The form factor is a 60%, which means that takes away a lot of keys from a common sized keyboard. Another plus is that it's wireless, I have it most of the time on bluetooth; and the battery does lasts for a good while.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="mouse" class="details__item">
            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->
            <h2 class="details__heading">Logitech MX Master 3</h2>
            <p class="details__description">This offers a lot, it has a long lasting battery and charges fairly quick; it has 2 scroll wheels, the conventional one and horizontal scroll, two side buttons which can be configured with whatever you like, and an additional button that sits below your thumb, and when you press it and move the mouse in a certain direction, you can make it do something or open something. The first time I used it was a strange feeling mouse but after using it is a very comfortable productive ergonomic mouse.</p>

          <div id="headset" class="details__item">
            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->
            <h2 class="details__heading">HyperX cloud stinger</h2>
            <p class="details__description">I bought this headset for gaming purposes, but well... it's great for calls and satisfies my needs in the audio department. I have had it for quite some time, and after all the beating it has received it still holds strong which is quite surprising at this point.</p>

            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->

            <p class="details__description">The very popular drawers that are in most setups, very well made.</p>

            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->
            <h2 class="details__heading">Baseus Monitor Light Bar</h2>
            <p class="details__description">I work on my computer in a room with very poor lighting, and when it gets too dark the illumination of the monitor on your eyes will slowly degrade your vision. I learned this the hard way, so I got this light bar that sits on top of your monitor, it will help reduce eye strain on a dark room, and can light up your desk in case you need the extra lighthing. It has 3 color ways and the brightness can be adjusted. Another must have item for late night working sessions.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="keyboard2" class="details__item">
            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->
            <h2 class="details__heading">Logitech MX Keys</h2>
            <p class="details__description">Yes, another keyboard; but this one is a low profile keyboard, the typing experience is different from my main mechanical keyboard, also this is a 100% keyboard which has all the common keys you would find in a keyboard. What I like about it is that there is very few sound while typing, and typing is similar to typing on a laptop keyboard. It can be used wired or wireless.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="laptop" class="details__item">
            <!-- <img class="details__image" src="/images/desk.jpg" alt="Autonomous Standing Desk"> -->
            <h2 class="details__heading">DELL G15</h2>
            <p class="details__description">Not my laptop but its the laptop from the company I'm currently working. Nothing special about it, but I installed a Linux distribution called Zorin OS and installed a window manager called Awesome. I really like that you can really customize however you want it, also you can remove any software you don't want from it. I'm still learning Linux and the benefits it can give me.</p>
